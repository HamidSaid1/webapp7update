# AutoTrade Plus - Interactive Brokers Trading Application

## Overview

AutoTrade Plus is a sophisticated Python-based trading application that integrates with Interactive Brokers (IBKR) to provide real-time market analysis, automated trading strategies, and comprehensive risk management. The application features an advanced technical analysis engine, adaptive trading algorithms, and a comprehensive GUI for monitoring and control.

## System Architecture

The application follows a modular, event-driven architecture with clear separation of concerns:

- **Frontend**: Tkinter-based GUI with real-time data visualization and control panels
- **Backend**: Asynchronous trading engine with IBKR API integration using ib-insync
- **Analysis Engine**: Advanced technical analysis module with multiple indicators and adaptive algorithms
- **Risk Management**: Comprehensive risk assessment, position sizing, and trade validation
- **Configuration**: Centralized configuration management with environment variable support
- **Logging**: Multi-level logging system with file rotation and structured output

## Key Components

### 1. Trading Engine (`trading_engine.py`)
- **Purpose**: Core trading logic and IBKR API integration
- **Architecture**: Asynchronous event-driven design using asyncio
- **Key Features**:
  - Real-time market data streaming
  - Sophisticated order management and execution
  - Portfolio tracking and P&L calculation
  - Integration with technical analysis and risk management modules
  - Force trade mode with cooldown mechanisms

### 2. Technical Analyzer (`technical_analyzer.py`)
- **Purpose**: Advanced market analysis and signal generation
- **Architecture**: Modular indicator system with adaptive thresholds
- **Indicators Implemented**:
  - RSI (Relative Strength Index) with dynamic periods
  - Bollinger Bands with adaptive standard deviations
  - Stochastic Oscillator with K/D periods
  - Volume analysis and trend detection
  - Price slope analysis using linear regression
  - Support/resistance level identification
  - Momentum and volatility calculations

### 3. Risk Manager (`risk_manager.py`)
- **Purpose**: Comprehensive trade validation and position management
- **Architecture**: Rule-based system with configurable limits
- **Features**:
  - Daily loss limits and trade count restrictions
  - Maximum position size enforcement
  - Symbol-specific cooldown periods
  - Portfolio exposure management
  - Drawdown tracking and protection

### 4. GUI Components (`gui_components.py`)
- **Purpose**: Sophisticated user interface for monitoring and control
- **Architecture**: Tkinter-based with threaded updates
- **Features**:
  - Real-time market data display with color-coded indicators
  - Trade execution controls with parameter adjustment
  - Portfolio monitoring and P&L tracking
  - Technical analysis visualization
  - Risk management dashboard
  - Configuration management interface

### 5. Configuration Management (`config.py`)
- **Purpose**: Centralized configuration with dataclass structure
- **Features**:
  - IBKR connection parameters
  - Trading strategy parameters
  - Technical analysis settings
  - Risk management limits
  - GUI preferences

### 6. Utility Functions (`utils.py`)
- **Purpose**: Common calculations and formatting functions
- **Features**:
  - Position size calculations based on risk tolerance
  - Currency and percentage formatting
  - Data validation and parsing
  - Time difference calculations

## Data Flow

1. **Market Data Flow**:
   - IBKR API → Trading Engine → Technical Analyzer → GUI Display
   - Real-time price updates trigger technical analysis recalculation
   - Analysis results update GUI indicators and trading signals

2. **Trading Decision Flow**:
   - Technical Analysis → Signal Generation → Risk Manager Validation → Order Execution
   - Force trade mode bypasses some automatic signals but maintains risk controls

3. **Risk Management Flow**:
   - All trades pass through risk manager before execution
   - Continuous monitoring of daily limits and portfolio exposure
   - Automatic position sizing based on configured risk parameters

## External Dependencies

## Deployment Strategy

The application is configured for deployment on Replit with the following setup:

1. **Environment**: Python 3.11 with Nix package management
2. **Dependencies**: Automatic installation via pip during deployment
3. **Execution**: Single command deployment with `python main.py`
4. **Port Configuration**: Configured to wait for port 5000 (though primarily GUI-based)

### Deployment Configuration
- **Runtime**: Python 3.11 with pre-installed scientific computing packages
- **Package Management**: Nix for system packages, pip for Python packages
- **Workflow**: Automated setup and execution via Replit workflows
